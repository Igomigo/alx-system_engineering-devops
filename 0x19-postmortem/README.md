Web Stack Debugging: Resolving a Critical Database Connection Outage

Issue Summary:
Duration: July 15, 2023, 09:00 AM - July 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: Database service downtime affecting user authentication and data retrieval
Impact Percentage: Approximately 30% of users experienced degraded performance or inability to access the service.

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a sudden spike in the number of active database connections. The database server's connection pool capacity was exhausted due to a misconfiguration in connection pooling settings.

Timeline:
- 09:00 AM: Issue detected through a sudden increase in response times and user reports of login failures.
- 09:15 AM: Engineers initiated investigation, monitoring the database server's performance metrics.
- 09:30 AM: Initial assumption made that a potential query bottleneck could be causing the issue.
- 09:45 AM: Investigated query performance and indexing but found no anomalies.
- 10:00 AM: Issue escalated to the Database Operations team.
- 10:30 AM: Investigation revealed a high number of active connections; suspected connection leak issue.
- 11:00 AM: Incorrectly identified a problematic database query that led to misleading debugging efforts.
- 11:30 AM: Escalated the incident to the System Administration team for further assistance.

Resolution:
Root Cause: A misconfigured connection pool setting caused the database server to allow more connections than intended, overwhelming the capacity and causing timeouts.
Resolution: The connection pool settings were adjusted to limit the maximum number of allowed connections, and a connection leak fix was applied to the codebase.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Implement automatic monitoring for database connections to catch potential connection leaks.
- Regularly review and fine-tune connection pool settings based on usage patterns.
- Implement load testing scenarios to validate the behavior of the system under high connection loads.
- Improve collaboration and communication between development, operations, and system administration teams to swiftly resolve critical issues.

Moving Forward:
The incident served as a valuable learning experience for our team. We identified the need for enhanced monitoring, improved communication channels, and proactive performance testing to prevent similar issues in the future. The collaboration between different teams during the incident resolution also highlighted the importance of cross-functional knowledge sharing.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Implement automatic connection leak detection and alerting.
2. Review and update connection pool settings to align with expected usage.
3. Conduct load testing scenarios to simulate high connection loads and optimize settings.
4. Enhance documentation on database connection management for the development team.
